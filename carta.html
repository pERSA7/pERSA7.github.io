                            Hello...
                            You probably don't want to hear anything from me anymore.
                            And honestly, I get it.
                            But this… this is my last attempt to fix something that maybe can't be fixed anymore.
                            I've got nothing to lose by trying —I already lost everything.
                            You don't need to know who I am...
                            But I guess you're guessing JAJAJJ. But that's not the point.
                            Sometimes people talk too much. Sometimes what's real gets hidden between words that were never ours.
                            Sometimes people talk too much.
                            Sometimes what's true drowns in words that never belonged to us.
                            And the saddest thing is that, amid so many versions, the most real part of us gets lost.
                            The part that felt the most.
                            The part that wanted to do beautiful things like this for you, always.
                            From the beginning, I wanted to give you details, gestures, moments that would stay with you.
                            But there were voices that made it their job to dirty that.
                            And because of those voices, that confusion, it showed you an image of me that I'm not.
                            I don't know if you could ever see who I really was...
                            But I hope you felt it.
                            I'm not here to change anything. Just so you can remember, even for a second, how everything felt when there were no doubts, when the only thing that mattered was what happened between us, without third parties, without suspicions.
                            Maybe it won't make a difference. Maybe you'll just read this and move on with your life. But if there's something inside you that hasn't completely gone out, even if it's just a spark... this will find you.
                            If you ever wonder who felt you the most, who was there even when it wasn't noticeable, who was more sincere than the rest...
                            If you understand this message, you will know what to do. 
                            Where always.
