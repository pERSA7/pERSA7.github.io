                            Hello...
                                You don't need to know who I am...
                                But I guess you're guessing JAJAJJ. But that's not the point.
                                Sometimes people talk too much. Sometimes the real thing gets hidden between words that were never ours.
                                But there are things that don't change, even if the world turns, even if everything seems different. There are glances that aren't forgotten, silences that said more than a thousand words, and moments that live on even if no one mentions them.
                                I'm not here to change anything. Just so you can remember, even for a second, how everything felt when there were no doubts, when the only thing that mattered was what happened between us, without filters, without third parties, without suspicions.
                                Maybe it won't make a difference. Maybe you'll just read this and move on with your life. But if there's something inside you that hasn't completely gone out, even if it's just a spark... this will find you.
                                If you ever wonder who felt you the most, who was there even when it wasn't noticeable, who was more sincere than the rest...
                                If you understand this message, you will know what to do..<br> ahre lo escribia en ingles <br><br>
